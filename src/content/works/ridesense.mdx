RideSense is a community-driven platform that enables motorcycle and bicycle enthusiasts to discover, share, and connect through their riding experiences. Launched in 2024, RideSense serves as a digital hub for riders of all levels to explore new routes, document their journeys, and build connections with fellow riding enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Route Discovery:** Browse and filter through user-contributed riding routes based on difficulty, terrain, scenery, and distance.

- **Experience Sharing:** Document riding experiences with photos, videos, and detailed descriptions that capture the essence of each journey.

- **Community Connection:** Connect with other riders, follow their activities, and organize group rides through the platform.

- **Performance Tracking:** Monitor and analyze riding statistics including distance, elevation, speed, and more through integration with popular fitness trackers.

## Technical Implementation

RideSense is built using a modern tech stack designed for performance and scalability:

- **Frontend:** Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express handling API requests and real-time connections
- **Database:** MongoDB for flexible data storage and retrieval
- **Maps Integration:** Leveraging Mapbox API for interactive route visualization and creation
- **Media Storage:** AWS S3 for efficient storage of user-uploaded photos and videos

## Challenges

### Real-time Location Tracking
Implementing efficient real-time location tracking for group rides while minimizing battery consumption on mobile devices was a significant challenge. The solution involved optimizing the polling frequency and implementing a smart tracking algorithm.

### Route Visualization
Creating an intuitive interface for viewing and creating complex routes required careful consideration of user experience and performance. The implementation uses vector-based rendering with elevation data to provide rich, interactive maps.
